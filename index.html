  <b>What is healthy living?</b>
  "Healthy living" to most people means both physical and mental health 
  are in balance or functioning well together. In many instances, physical
  and mental health are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one 
  directly affects the other. Consequently, some of the tips will include 
  suggestions for emotional and mental "healthy living."

  <b>Healthy eating (diet and nutrition)</b>
  All humans have to eat food for growth and maintenance of a healthy body,
  but we humans have different nutrition requirements as infants, children (kids),
  teenagers, young adults, adults, and seniors. For example, infants may require
  feeding every 4 hours until they gradually age and begin to take in more solid 
  foods. Eventually they develop into the more normal pattern of eating three times 
  per day as young kids. However, as most parents know, kids, teenagers, and young adults
  often snack between meals. Snacking is often not limited to these age groups because 
  adults and seniors often do the same.

  <b>Additional tips for healthy living</b>
  Although there are many other risky behaviors that may impede an otherwise
  healthy lifestyle (for example, working with toxic or radioactive materials, 
  drug addiction, travel to areas with unusual endemic diseases), 
  these are too numerous to cover in this general article. However, the reader is 
  advised to visit such topic sites on MedicineNet.com, eMedicineHealth.com or WebMD.com 
  because most of the specific articles will provide tips to avoid health-related problems.

  <b>Home Workout and Fitness Tips: Exercising without the Gym</b>
  Whether you’re working at home, traveling, or social distancing, 
  it isn’t always possible to get to the gym. But these tips can help you stay active
  and healthy whatever your circumstances.
  
  <b>The importance of staying active</b>
  When you’re stuck at home, traveling with work, on vacation, or quarantining, 
  it isn’t always easy to stick to an exercise routine or maintain your fitness goals.
  You may only have limited access to fitness facilities or find it difficult
  to adjust to a new routine. Perhaps you miss the camaraderie of your gym, 
  the familiarity of swimming laps in your local pool, or the social connection 
  from walking or hiking with your usual group of workout buddies.
  If you’re used to attending a fitness class with a motivating instructor, 
  you might also be disappointed in the intensity of workouts on your own.
  
  Maintaining an exercise routine at home or in a hotel room can seem more like 
  a ‘should’ than a ‘want to’. And with so many of us out of work and struggling
  financially at the moment, maintaining a gym membership and staying active can seem
  like much less of a priority. However, even a small amount of activity can make a
  huge difference to how well you think and feel. In fact, exercise is one of the 
  most powerful tools we have for staying physically and mentally healthy—and you 
  don’t need access to a gym or expensive health club to reap the rewards.
  
  Exercise can help ease depression, stress, and anxiety, and aid in the management
  of chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. By finding new
  ways to get moving and stay motivated, you can take charge of your mood and 
  well-being, retain a sense of control during these days of great uncertainty,
  and stay on track with your exercise goals even when your normal routine is 
  disrupted.
